# LLM Lead Classification

## Goal
Classify leads using Claude for complex distinctions that keyword matching can't handle.

## When to Use
- Product SaaS vs IT consulting agencies
- High-ticket vs low-ticket businesses
- Subscription vs one-time payment models
- NOT for simple categories (dentists, realtors)

## Scripts
- `./scripts/classify_leads_llm.py` - Main classification script
- `./scripts/update_sheet.py` - Update sheets
- `./scripts/read_sheet.py` - Read from sheets

## Usage

```bash
python3 ./scripts/classify_leads_llm.py .tmp/leads.json \
  --classification_type product_saas \
  --output .tmp/classified_leads.json
```

## Performance
- ~2 minutes for 3,000 leads
- ~$0.30 per 1,000 leads
- Default: includes "unclear" classifications (medium confidence)

## Classification Types
- `product_saas`: Product companies vs service/consulting
- Custom types can be added

## Output
JSON file with classification added to each lead record.
