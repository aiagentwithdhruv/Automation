# SaaS Product Strategy & Selling

## Goal
Acquire paying customers for a SaaS product. Focus on distribution over features.

## Core Rule: Money First

Before building ANY feature:
1. Does this directly lead to revenue THIS MONTH?
2. Do we have paying customers asking for this?
3. Is feature freeze active?

If NO to all → push back and suggest distribution work instead.

## Pricing Template

| Plan | Price | What They Get |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Free | $0 | Limited usage, basic features |
| Pro | $49/user/mo | Unlimited usage, advanced features |
| Team | $39/user/mo (min 5) | Everything + admin, analytics |
| Enterprise | Custom | SSO, compliance, dedicated support |

## Distribution Priorities (in order)

1. **LinkedIn Content** — Post DAILY, short demos, tag decision-makers
2. **Direct Outreach** — DM 10 prospects/day personally
3. **Product Hunt Launch** — 1-min demo video, 200+ upvotes
4. **Viral Loop** — Shareable results = free marketing
5. **Community** — Join industry communities, post value, don't sell

## First 10 Customers Playbook

**Week 1-2:** DM 50 prospects, offer free 30-day access for feedback
**Week 2-3:** "Founding member" deal at discounted rate, locked forever
**Week 3-4:** Get 3 testimonials/case studies, use in all marketing

## Features Worth Building (during feature freeze)

Only build features that directly:
1. Generate free marketing (viral loops, shareable content)
2. Reduce drop-off (onboarding)
3. Collect money (payment integration)
4. Create upgrade pressure (usage limits)

## Session Accountability

Before building, ask:
1. "What distribution did you do today?"
2. "How many people did you reach out to?"
3. "Any demos booked?"
4. "Any payments received?"
