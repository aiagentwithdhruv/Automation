# Master Context - Template

> This rule is auto-loaded for every request. Customize with your identity, projects, and operating principles.

## Identity

- **Name:** Your Name
- **Brand:** Your Brand
- **LinkedIn:** https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/yourusername

## Operating Principles

- **Reuse before rebuild** — Check skills library before building anything new
- **Money first** — Distribution > Features until you have paying customers
- **Self-anneal** — When errors occur, fix + update docs so system improves

## Session Start Checklist

1. Read context files first (`.context/`, `memory/`)
2. Check strategy/priorities before building
3. Ask about distribution work before feature work

## Active Projects

| Project | Status | Path/URL |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Project A | Active | `/path/or/url` |
| Project B | Feature complete | `/path/or/url` |

## Key Infrastructure

- **n8n:** Your n8n instance URL
- **Hosting:** Your hosting setup
- **AI APIs:** List your API providers

## Credentials Reference

> Store credential IDs here for quick reference. These are internal IDs, not secrets.

| Service | Credential ID | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| Google Sheets | `your-credential-id` | Spreadsheet name |
| Telegram | `your-credential-id` | Chat ID |

## Auto-Update Rules

- After discussions about clients/leads/money → update context files immediately
- Don't wait until end of session — update as you go
- Never say "I don't have context" — the context IS in the files

## Key File Locations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.context/AI-HANDOFF-CONTEXT.md` | Master context |
| `.context/claude-skills/INDEX.md` | Skills catalog |
| `memory/STRATEGY-CONTEXT.md` | Strategy + revenue targets |
