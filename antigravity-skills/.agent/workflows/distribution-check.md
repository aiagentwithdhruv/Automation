# /distribution

Before building anything, ask these accountability questions:

1. "What distribution did you do today?"
2. "How many people did you reach out to?"
3. "Any demos booked?"
4. "Any payments received?"

## Rules

- If no distribution work was done → suggest distribution tasks FIRST
- Distribution priorities (in order):
  1. LinkedIn posts (5/week target)
  2. Direct DMs to prospects (10/day target)
  3. Product Hunt prep
  4. Community engagement
- Only proceed to building after confirming distribution effort
